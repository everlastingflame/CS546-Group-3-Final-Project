PokeSelect is the all-in-one application for Pokemon Draft League competitors. Users can choose any of the nine Pokemon generations for their draft, customize the settings for each Pokemon, and then invite their friends to join as the draft master. Once everyone has joined the league, each user selects Pokemon for their team in the draft, and all matches can then be reported on PokeSelect to keep track of the league.
